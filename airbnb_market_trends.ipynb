{"cells":[{"source":"![NYC Skyline](nyc.jpg)\n\nWelcome to New York City, one of the most-visited cities in the world. There are many Airbnb listings in New York City to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, which can be anywhere between a few nights to many months. In this project, we will take a closer look at the New York Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like `.csv`, `.tsv`, and `.xlsx`.\n\nRecall that **CSV**, **TSV**, and **Excel** files are three common formats for storing data. \nThree files containing data on 2019 Airbnb listings are available to you:\n\n**data/airbnb_price.csv**\nThis is a CSV file containing data on Airbnb listing prices and locations.\n- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n- **`price`**: nightly listing price in USD\n- **`nbhood_full`**: name of borough and neighborhood where listing is located\n\n**data/airbnb_room_type.xlsx**\nThis is an Excel file containing data on Airbnb listing descriptions and room types.\n- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n- **`description`**: listing description\n- **`room_type`**: Airbnb has three types of rooms: shared rooms, private rooms, and entire homes/apartments\n\n**data/airbnb_last_review.tsv**\nThis is a TSV file containing data on Airbnb host names and review dates.\n- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n- **`host_name`**: name of listing host\n- **`last_review`**: date when the listing was last reviewed","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6"},"id":"c747d469-ee97-4b95-880f-feefd5456042","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Import necessary packages\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load the TSV file containing review dates\nairbnb_last_review = pd.read_csv('data/airbnb_last_review.tsv', sep='\\t')\n\n# Convert the 'last_review' column to datetime format for proper date comparisons\nairbnb_last_review['last_review'] = pd.to_datetime(airbnb_last_review['last_review'])\n\n# Find the earliest review date in the dataset\nearliest_review = airbnb_last_review['last_review'].min()\n\n# Find the most recent review date in the dataset\nmost_recent_review = airbnb_last_review['last_review'].max()\n\n# Print the earliest and most recent review dates\nprint(\"Earliest review:\", earliest_review)\nprint(\"Most recent review:\", most_recent_review)\n\n# Load the Excel file containing room type information\nairbnb_room_type = pd.read_excel('data/airbnb_room_type.xlsx')\n\n# Normalize room_type strings to lowercase and count how many are 'private room'\nnum_private_rooms = (airbnb_room_type['room_type'].str.lower() == 'private room').sum()\n\n# Print the number of listings that are private rooms\nprint(\"Number of Listings of Private rooms:\", num_private_rooms)\n\n# Load the CSV file containing listing prices\nairbnb_price = pd.read_csv('data/airbnb_price.csv')\n\n# Remove the word 'dollars' from the 'price' column and convert to float\nairbnb_price['price'] = airbnb_price['price'].str.replace('dollars', '', regex=False).astype(float)\n\n# Calculate the average listing price and round to 2 decimal places\naverage_listing_price = airbnb_price['price'].mean().round(2)\n\n# Print the average listing price\nprint(\"Average listing price:\", average_listing_price)\n\n# Combine all summary information into a single-row DataFrame\nreview_dates = pd.DataFrame([{\n    'first_reviewed': earliest_review,        # Earliest review date\n    'last_reviewed': most_recent_review,      # Most recent review date\n    'nb_private_rooms': num_private_rooms,    # Number of private room listings\n    'avg_price': average_listing_price        # Average price of all listings\n}])\n\n# Display the resulting summary DataFrame\nprint(review_dates)\n","metadata":{"executionTime":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":null,"executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":null,"lastExecutedByKernel":null,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":143,"type":"stream"},"1":{"height":550,"type":"dataFrame","tableState":{"customFilter":{"const":{"type":"boolean","valid":true,"value":true},"id":"fecd7911-1d9c-4dbb-b43f-8edfc4669eb0","nodeType":"const"}}}}},"id":"1fdc5784-479e-46cb-b05b-68439dcc94a7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":44,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"Earliest review: 2019-01-01 00:00:00\nMost recent review: 2019-07-09 00:00:00\nNumber of Listings of Private rooms: 11356\nAverage listing price: 141.78\n  first_reviewed last_reviewed  nb_private_rooms  avg_price\n0     2019-01-01    2019-07-09             11356     141.78\n"}]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"editor":"DataLab"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
